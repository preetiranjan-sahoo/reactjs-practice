Introduction to React.js**

- React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications.
- It allows developers to create reusable UI components.

JSX (JavaScript XML)**

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML within JavaScript.
- It must be transpiled using Babel before being rendered in the browser.

Components in React**

- Components are reusable UI elements and can be functional or class-based.
- Functional components use functions, while class components use ES6 classes.

### **Types of Components in React**

- **Functional Components**: These are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
- **Class Components**: These are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and have lifecycle methods.
- **Controlled Components**: Form elements whose value is controlled by state.
- **Uncontrolled Components**: Form elements that manage their own state using refs.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: Functions that take a component and return an enhanced version of it.
- **Pure Components**: Optimized class components that prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Props in React**

- Props (properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
- Props are immutable and read-only.

PropTypes**
-A mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct datatype.
-age: Proptypes.number

State in React**

- State is a built-in object that stores dynamic data in a component.
- `useState` hook is used to manage state in functional components.

Handling Events in React**

- React events are handled using camelCase syntax, e.g., `onClick`.
- Event handlers are functions that execute when an event occurs.

Conditional Rendering**

- Conditional rendering in React is done using `if-else`, ternary operators, or logical `&&`.
- It controls the UI rendering based on conditions.

Lists and Keys**

- Lists in React are used to render multiple items dynamically.
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or removed.

Forms in React**

- Forms in React handle user input using controlled or uncontrolled components.
- Controlled components use state, while uncontrolled components use refs.

Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)**

- Lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
- These methods manage the component's behavior during its lifecycle.

Hooks in React**

- Hooks are functions that let functional components use state and lifecycle features.
- Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useRef`.

useEffect Hook**

- `useEffect` allows performing side effects in function components.
- It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.

useContext Hook**

- `useContext` provides a way to share values between components without passing props manually.
- It simplifies state management across multiple components.

React Router**

- React Router enables navigation between different pages in a React application.
- Components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, and `Link` manage routing.

State Management in React**

- State can be managed using Context API, Redux, or Zustand.
- Redux is used for global state management across the application.

Redux in React**

- Redux is a state management library that follows a unidirectional data flow.
- It uses `actions`, `reducers`, and a central `store`.

React Query**

- React Query manages data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- It simplifies API requests and data synchronization with the backend.

React Performance Optimization**

- Use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to optimize performance.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders using proper dependency arrays in hooks.

React Lazy Loading and Suspense**

- `React.lazy` dynamically imports components to reduce initial load time.
- `Suspense` helps in handling loading states while components load asynchronously.

React Portals**

- React Portals allow rendering a child component into a different part of the DOM.
- Useful for rendering modals and tooltips outside the main component hierarchy.

Error Boundaries in React**

- Error Boundaries catch and handle JavaScript errors in a component tree.
- Implemented using `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` in class components.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React**

- SSR renders React components on the server before sending them to the client.
- Next.js is a popular framework for implementing SSR in React.

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) in React**

- React can be used to build PWAs that work offline with service workers.
- `create-react-app` includes built-in support for PWAs.

Connecting React with Backend**

- React connects with backends using RESTful APIs or GraphQL.
- `Axios` and `fetch` are commonly used for making API requests.

React with Firebase**

- Firebase provides authentication, database, and storage services for React apps.
- Used for real-time applications without managing backend infrastructure.

React with WebSockets**

- WebSockets enable real-time communication in React applications.
- `socket.io` is commonly used for implementing WebSockets in React.

Testing in React**

- React applications are tested using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Unit tests check components, while integration tests verify functionality.

Deploying a React Application**

- React apps can be deployed using Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Firebase Hosting.
- `npm run build` generates optimized files for production deployment.

React Best Practices**

- Keep components small and reusable.
- Use state management wisely to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Follow accessibility guidelines for better usability.
